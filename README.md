# BST-LinkedList-PrimeGap
Creates a random array of numbers (size given in first command line argument, range given in second), prints, inserts them into a binary search tree, prints the tree in-order, converts to a linked list, then prints. Prime gap finds the largest gap between primes in a given range (passed as command line arguments)
